## What is Business Intelligence (BI)?
**Business Intelligence (BI)** involves using data from internal and external sources to gain insights and optimize business decisions and outcomes. BI aligns with strategic planning and helps organizations adapt to changing market conditions. By analyzing past and current data, teams can anticipate trends in operations and markets. These analyses are typically performed with specialized software tools.

## Data Analysis
**Data analysis** is the process of deriving insights from data, identifying patterns, evaluating cause and effect relationships, and making estimations using statistical and analytical methods. Once analysis is complete, communicating findings clearly and accurately is essential so stakeholders can take informed action.

## Data Visualizations
Effective visualizations, charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards. They help translate complex information into digestible insights. Tools range from spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel) to analytics platforms that produce interactive dashboards with infographics, gauges, geographic maps, sparklines, heatmaps, and more. Visualizations can clarify patterns and problems that may be difficult to detect in text-only formats.

## About Microsoft Power BI
**Microsoft Power BI** is a robust tool for interactive visualizations and in-depth analysis. It integrates with Microsoft services (e.g., Excel, SQL Server, Azure) and many third‑party data sources (e.g., Salesforce). Power BI supports building end‑to‑end analytics workflows and rich dashboards for business users.
